# Mobile-e-coleta
This project was made with the intention of knowing and learning new technologies, this is my first project built using React-native, all the contents of this project and the respective libraries were provided or indicated in a training offered by RocketSeat at NLW (Next Level Week).


the following technologies were used.
_React-Native_ as the main library, _Expo_ to facilitate and speed up the build process, _Axios_ for the creation of services and _Typescript_ as a language for greater scalability and greater readability of the generated code.

to execute the project it is necessary to use the e-coleta backend https://github.com/bryandsg/BackEnd-e-coleta and then just run the `npm start` script
